# nosql-challenge

-During this challenge most of the material referenced came from rewatching lectures as well as assistance during office hours. I also received help from fellow peers with clafication on certain tasks.

-Similar to many of the past challenges Chatgpt was used for refreshers on certain methods and functions within the libraries used. I also used the lectures and previous in class assignments for much of the code used during this homework
